# ToDoWebApplication

 - This is fully working solution (both UI and backend with react and .Net Core) with Azure resources, not using in memory database due to it's written in .Net Core 3.1
 - This app is a POC of using Event Sourcing Pattern to implement a Todo Item app - no data modification, only append, getting data by replaying the events, no data cache view has been implemented
 - This project doesn't contain any tests but has been designed to be easy to test
 - Code refactoring and refining are required
